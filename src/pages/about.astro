            <p class="mt-4"> Hi there, thanks for visiting! üëã My "Spellman Magic" is software development*. Are you curious if I have the skillset you need? <a href="/#skills"> <strong> Click here </strong> </a></p> 
            
            <p class="mt-4 mb-2">  I've always enjoyed using technology, whether by:  </p>

                        <li> Building computers </li>
                        <li> Playing classic games like Final Fantasy 7 with emulators </li>
                         <li> Styling MySpace and Neopets profiles </li>
                         <li> Or saving others from technical issues such as vengeful printers and stubborn computer errors</li>
                
                </ul>
            
            <p class="mt-4"> My journey to code actually began when I worked at an animal shelter! I built an automated audiobook program, which reduced the stress levels of shelter pets and increased positive outcomes. Every since then, I've been using code to solve real world problems by building websites and full-stack applications. </p>

           <p class="mt-4">* If "Spellman Magic" does not ring a bell, look up Sabrina the Teenage Witch. It was a popular 90s sitcom following the "Spellman" family of witches. Coincidentally (or magically?), that is my last name too. üòâ.</p>
